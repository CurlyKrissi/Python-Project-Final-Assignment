Apparently, make_graph fuction works only with Tesla Data. The error shows that str doesn't have Date attribute, even though both parameters used to build the graph are not string object and both of them contain Date argumemt as you can see from the previous outputs. The reason for this stays unclear, share if you have ideas abot this please.
